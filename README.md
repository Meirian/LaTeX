We offer free workshops and community events for researchers throughout the year to teach the valuable digital tool skills needed to take your research to the next level. We are researchers, training researchers!

## **What is the Digital Research Skills Support Pack?**

We are here to support you while youâ€™re working from home. You can learn the digital research skills you need with our support pack, which has three key components**:**

1. **Online trainings:** Join short online trainings and virtual help hours via zoom with our team. [Click here to sign up to attend our free training and community events on Eventbrite.](http://rescomunimelb.eventbrite.com)
2. **Self-paced tutorials:** Access to online modules, where you can work through training materials to learn the relevant digital research skill, catering to all levels, including beginner & advanced. [Click here to view our repository of self-paced tutorials.](https://gitlab.unimelb.edu.au/rescom-training)
3. **E-learning videos:** Watch videos which explain how the tools are used in research and teach you the skills you need. [Click here to watch fun videos on YouTube!](http://youtube.com/researchcomputingservices_unimelb)

### Using this Resource

This resource is designed to help students learn new digital tools and skills online. At Research Computing Services, we coordinate communities for a wide variety of digital tools for researchers.

This Digital Support Pack is for **LaTeX**. LaTeX is software which allows researchers to report and publish their research. This support pack is split into several modules which can be completed either as a self-paced self-learning lab, or with the facilitation of a trainer via webinar software such as Zoom.

### What is Blended Learning?

Blended learning is the combination of traditional student-centred in-class learning with other complementary learning methodologies. This resource is currently intended as an accessible alternative to in-class learning which has been made unavailable due to COVID-19. The modules blend written guides, engaging videos, and hands-on challenges. Online webinars aim to provide hands-on support and to reinforce the content of the modules. The in-class workshops focus on problem-based group challenges - which we hope to have maintained on this online resource.

## Our Philosophy

We believe in community and empowering researchers. We believe in researchers helping researchers, and working smarter not harder. We avoid teaching as a death by PowerPoint, and we don't want you to learn new digital tools by watching a screen. Instead, we have faith in our students and focus on a problem-based pedagogical approach. 

Learning new digital tools can be hard, especially when your research interests and methodologies are diverse and complex. As such, we firmly believe in supporting and empowering communities of researchers to help each other. Our trainers cannot answer all the questions that you might have about the applicability of digital tools to your research, but we hope that by creating a community of researchers that someone might be able to help you out.

### Community

Our goal at Research Computing Services is to build communities of digitally empowered researchers at the University of Melbourne. Traditionally, we have created communities by running social events, and offering pathways for researchers to involve themselves in our communities. These community leaders we refer to as ResLeads, and over the years they've been involved in taking the lead on running meetups where we teach advanced digital skills, and in connecting with specific faculties at the University to tailor the tools to their needs. Online, things are a little different and this is certainly new territory for us.
