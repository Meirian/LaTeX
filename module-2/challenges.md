During the workshop, group activities will be run using Breakout rooms in Zoom. These are referred to as challenges.

##  2.1 Getting started

* Introduce yourselves.
* Come up with a team name!
* Select one member of your team to create an Overleaf document and share this with the group by pasting the edit link in the chat.
* Set your team name as the `\author{ }`.

{% endhint %}

##  2.2 Lists

* Create a list of things which can happen during a video call using the `itemize` environment.
* Create a shopping list of items you would like to buy to get you through self-isolation. Use the `enumerate` environment to order the items on your list by priority.

Bonus challenges: 

* Add a nested list to one of your lists \(how many levels deep can you go?\)
* Change the symbol of one of the items in your unordered list to an asterisk \(\*\).
{% endhint %}

## 2.3 Bingo

* In your document, create a 3x3 bingo table for video conference calls.
* When you return, share a \(read only\) link to your Overleaf document in the group chat.
* Choose one member of your team to present your Overleaf document \(via screen share\) when you return.

Bonus challenges:

* Figure out how you can set the width of your table's columns \(you may need to Google this one!\)
* If you have extra time, expand your table to be 4x4. You can find inspiration in Google images if you're stuck.
* Create a free space and shade this cell in a different colour. You will need to use the `xcolor` package: `\usepackage[table]{xcolor}`.
