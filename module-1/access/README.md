# Accessing LaTeX

LaTeX is free and is open source software. It is available on Linux \(as TeXLive\), Mac \(MacTeX\), Windows \(MiKTeX\), and Online \(Overleaf\). Working online can be quick and easy: without installing anything, create your LaTeX document in a web browser then download the final PDF when its ready. However some may prefer to install LaTeX software on their own desktop or laptop computer. The strengths and weaknesses of both methods are discussed here to help you decide what's best for you: [http://resbaz.github.io/resbook-installation/latex](http://resbaz.github.io/resbook-installation/latex).

## Installing LaTeX

If you are interested in downloading a local distribution of LaTeX \(working offline\), I recommend that you follow Liantze's instructions on [Getting LaTeX to Work](http://liantze.penguinattack.org/getlatex.html). 

Once you have downloaded a [TeX distribution](https://www.latex-project.org/get/#tex-distributions), I recommend you choose a [LaTeX editor](https://beebom.com/best-latex-editors) \(there are many options to choose from - I recommend [TeXStudio](http://www.texstudio.org) or [TeXmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker)\).
