# Overleaf

LaTeX can be used entirely online, using Overleaf: [http://www.overleaf.com](http://www.overleaf.com). All our trainings are run using Overleaf, so you are expected to have an Overleaf account before attending the training. If you do not already have an account, you can create one for free.

The University of Melbourne is providing free Overleaf Professional accounts for all students, faculty and staff who would like to use a collaborative, online LaTeX editor for their projects. Overleaf Professional accounts provide real-time track changes, unlimited collaborators, and full document history. Upgrade to a pro Overleaf account by using a unimelb email address to create your Overleaf account. For more information see: [https://www.overleaf.com/edu/unimelb](https://www.overleaf.com/edu/unimelb).

I recommend viewing this guide to familiarise yourself with the layout of Overleaf:
