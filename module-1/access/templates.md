## Create Professional Documents with Ease using LaTeX Templates

On the 11th of April 2019 we held a meet-up on templates in LaTeX. The purpose of this event was not only to showcase some exemplary LaTeX templates, but also to show attendees how to use them. Keep reading to access the templates showcased in the meet-up, and to learn how to use them!

## What to look for in a template

* `\documentclass{}` This will determine the overall structure and layout of your document.
* `% comments` Comments begin with a percentage sign. They do not run commands nor display text in the output. Comments are used in templates to explain things and to give the template user options.
* `\begin{document}` This line signifies the start of the document content. Everything before this line is called the preamble, and forms the settings of your document.
* Errors or warnings: A good template will compile without any errors or warnings.

## How to use a template

Overleaf has a comprehensive guide for how to open and get started with a template:

We showed an example starting with this presentation template:

Following **What to look for in a template** above, we began by learning that this used a beamer document class. You can [learn more about beamer documents on Overleaf](https://href.li/?https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Beamer).

We also played around with the different options for the presentation template appearance, which were initially listed as comments in the preamble. You can view some of the different options for beamer documents in the [Beamer Theme Matrix](https://href.li/?https://hartwork.org/beamer-theme-matrix).

## Where to find good templates

If you are submitting a paper to a journal or conference, then you may be required to use a specific template. Otherwise, there is a wealth of templates available online. Here are some links to templates which may suit your needs:
