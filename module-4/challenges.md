# Challenges

During the workshop, group activities will be run using Breakout rooms in Zoom. These are referred to as challenges.

##  4.1 Introductions

* [ ] Introduce yourselves.
* [ ] Each team member should answer the question: if you were a tree, what sort of tree would you be? Here are some options if you need inspiration:
  * birch tree \(risilient\)
  * fruit tree \(lots to offer\)
  * oak tree \(strong\)
  * palm tree \(beachy\)
  * pine tree \(deep-rooted\)
  * willow tree \(protective\)
* [ ] Select one member of your team to create an Overleaf document and share this with the group by pasting the edit link in the chat.

## 4.2 Referencing

* [ ] Research and find one article about your chosen tree on Google Scholar.
* [ ] Add a bibliography item of the article you found to a bibtex file \(`.bib`\) in your shared Overleaf document.
* [ ] One member of your team should add the references to your `main.tex` file using the `plain` bibliography style.
