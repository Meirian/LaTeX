# Challenges

During the workshop, group activities will be run using Breakout rooms in Zoom. These are referred to as challenges.

##  2.1 Getting started

* Introduce yourselves.
* Each team member should answer the question: if you were a tree, what sort of tree would you be? Here are some options if you need inspiration:
  * birch tree \(tall and straight trunks, risilient\)
  * fruit tree \(lots to offer, fun\)
  * oak tree \(stable, strong\)
  * palm tree \(energetic, likes the beach and warm\)
  * pine tree \(family-oriented, deep-rooted, like the cold\)
  * willow \(patient, thoughtful\)
* Select one member of your team to create an Overleaf document and share this with the group by pasting the edit link in the chat.

## 4.2 Referencing

* Research and find one article about your chosen tree on Google Scholar.
* Add a bibliography item of the article you found to a bibtex file \(`.bib`\) in your shared Overleaf document.
* One member of your team should add the references to your `main.tex` file using the `plain` bibliography style.
* Each member of your team should add one sentence explaining which tree they selected, and include an in-text citation using the `\cite{ }` command.
