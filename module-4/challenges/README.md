# Challenges

During the workshop, group activities will be run using Breakout rooms in Zoom. These are referred to as challenges.

##  4.1 Introductions

* [ ] Introduce yourselves and answer the question: if you were a tree, what sort of tree would you be?  Here are some options if you need inspiration: birch tree, fruit tree, oak tree, palm tree, pine tree, willow tree.
* [ ] Select one member of your team to create an Overleaf document and share this with the group by pasting the edit link in the chat.

## 4.2 Referencing

* [ ] Research and find one article about your chosen tree on Google Scholar.
* [ ] Add a bibliography item of the article you found to a bibtex file \(`.bib`\) in your shared Overleaf document.
* [ ] One member of your team should add the references to your `main.tex` file using the `plain` bibliography style.
* [ ] Each member of your team should add one sentence explaining which tree they selected, and include an in-text citation using the `\cite{ }` command.
