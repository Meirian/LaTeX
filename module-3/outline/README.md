# Outline

Don’t miss out on this great opportunity to ask your burning mathematics documentation questions, learn some tips and tricks, and see some exemplary documents containing mathematics ...and while you're here, get to know the community that is actively using LaTeX to document their research! We will begin by showcasing some examples of mathematics and statistics in LaTeX. You will then have the opportunity to ask questions and try out some of things presented.

Please note that attendees are expected to have some familiarity/experience with LaTeX. If you are new to LaTeX, please attend our Getting Started with LaTeX Workshop.

To participate in the workshop, you will need:

* a computer \(or laptop\) with internet access and a web browser;
* Zoom installed on your computer --- you can download Zoom for free from [https://zoom.us/download](https://zoom.us/download);
* an Overleaf account --- you can create one for free here: www.overleaf.com.

Objective:

* Gain knowledge of the tools available for typesetting technical formulas in LaTeX.

Learning outcome:

* I can insert a given technical formula into a LaTeX using math mode.

Prior to the workshop, please read our [Training Welcome Page](https://gitlab.unimelb.edu.au/rescom-training/latex/welcome). This page contains a training overview, eligibility & requirements, expectations, support, training format and dates & times.

Know of a package for typesetting mathematics? Or, do you have a document containing mathematics which you're willing to share? We would love to showcase it! If you are interested in showcasing something, please send Meirian a quick email explaining what you would like to present. There is no need to prepare anything formal, having a running example is more than enough \(even if it is not your own creation\). 

Don’t feel like presenting anything? Don’t worry, just come along and immerse yourself in the knowledge that your peers have to share!
