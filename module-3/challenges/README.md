# Challenges

During the workshop, group activities will be run using Breakout rooms in Zoom. These are referred to as challenges.

##  3.1 Replicate this

* [ ] Replicate these examples using math-mode:

$$
\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right)=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
$$

Hint: You may find it helpful to refer to our [Cheat Sheet](../../resources/cheat.md).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Bonus challenge: Typeset the probability density function of the normal distribution.

$$
{\displaystyle f(x)={\frac {1}{\sigma {\sqrt {2\pi }}}}e^{-{\frac {1}{2}}\left({\frac {x-\mu }{\sigma }}\right)^{2}}}
$$
{% endhint %}

## 3.2 Your turn

* [ ] Copy the probability density function of the normal distribution into LaTeX.

$$
{\displaystyle f(x)={\frac {1}{\sigma {\sqrt {2\pi }}}}e^{-{\frac {1}{2}}\left({\frac {x-\mu }{\sigma }}\right)^{2}}}
$$

* [ ] Typeset the most difficult problem or equation you can think of or find!

{% hint style="success" %}
Bonus challenges: 

* [ ] Can you solve someone else's problem?
* [ ] Check out the [extension material](extension.md).
* [ ] Did you know you can run R code in LaTeX? [Read more here](../../resources/faq.md), and let me know if you'd be interested in a workshop on this.
