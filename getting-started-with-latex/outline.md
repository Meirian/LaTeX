# Outline

Determine whether LaTeX is for you! During this free workshop you will typeset an article in LaTeX, learn how to insert graphics and work as a team to compete in a challenge.

LaTeX is a mark-up language focused on beautiful typesetting, and handles large, complex documents with ease. It is a standard tool in scientific and technical research fields, and is well-suited to the needs of people in the humanities.

To participate in the workshop, you will need:

* a computer \(or laptop\) with internet access and a web browser;
* Zoom installed on your computer - you can download Zoom for free from [https://zoom.us/download](https://zoom.us/download);
