# Accessing LaTeX

LaTeX is free and is open source software. It is available on Linux \(as TeXLive\), Mac \(MacTeX\), Windows \(MiKTeX\), and Online. Working online can be quick and easy: without installing anything, create your LaTeX document in a web browser then download the final PDF when its ready. However some may prefer to install LaTeX software on their own desktop or laptop computer. The strengths and weaknesses of both methods are discussed here to help you decide what's best for you: [http://resbaz.github.io/resbook-installation/latex](http://resbaz.github.io/resbook-installation/latex).

## Online

LaTeX can be used entirely online, using Overleaf: [http://www.overleaf.com](http://www.overleaf.com). All our trainings are run using Overleaf, so you are expected to have an Overleaf account before attending the training. If you do not already have an account, you can create one for free.

The University of Melbourne is providing free Overleaf Professional accounts for all students, faculty and staff who would like to use a collaborative, online LaTeX editor for their projects. Overleaf Professional accounts provide real-time track changes, unlimited collaborators, and full document history. Upgrade to a pro Overleaf account by using a unimelb email address to create your Overleaf account. For more information see: [https://www.overleaf.com/edu/unimelb](https://www.overleaf.com/edu/unimelb).

I recommend viewing this guide to familiarise yourself with the layout of Overleaf:

## Offline

If you are interested in downloading a local distribution of LaTeX \(working offline\), I recommend that you follow Liantze's instructions on [Getting LaTeX to Work](http://liantze.penguinattack.org/getlatex.html). Once you have downloaded a [TeX distribution](https://www.latex-project.org/get/#tex-distributions), I recommend you choose a [LaTeX editor](https://beebom.com/best-latex-editors) \(there are many options to choose from - I recommend [TeXStudio](http://www.texstudio.org) or [TeXmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker)\).
