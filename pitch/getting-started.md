# Getting started

LaTeX can be used entirely online, using Overleaf:

If you are interested in downloading a local distribution of LaTeX \(working offline\), I recommend that you follow the instructions on [Getting LaTeX to Work](http://liantze.penguinattack.org/getlatex.html). Once you have downloaded a [TeX distribution](https://www.latex-project.org/get/#tex-distributions}{TeX), I recommend you choose a [LaTeX editor](https://beebom.com/best-latex-editors/}{\LaTeX{}) \(there are many options to choose from --- I recommend [TeXStudio](http://www.texstudio.org}{TeXStudio}) or [TeXmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker}{TeXmaker})\).

### History

TeX was released by Donald Knuth and Leslie Lamport released the set of extensions, resulting in what we now know as LaTeX.
